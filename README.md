## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- npm or yarn
- A Google API key with access to Gemini API

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/
   cd Gemini-Search
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

   ```
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## Environment Variables

- `GOOGLE_API_KEY`: Your Google API key with access to Gemini API
- `NODE_ENV`: Set to "development" by default, use "production" for production builds

## Development

- `npm run dev`: Start the development server
- `npm run build`: Build for production
- `npm run start`: Run the production server
- `npm run check`: Run TypeScript type checking

## Security Notes

- Never commit your `.env` file or expose your API keys
- The `.gitignore` file is configured to exclude sensitive files

## Deployment to Vercel

This application has been optimized for deployment on Vercel. The project uses a hybrid approach:

1. Static client-side assets served by Vercel
2. API routes handled as serverless functions

To deploy on Vercel:

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Set the following environment variables in your Vercel project settings:
   - `GOOGLE_API_KEY`: Your Gemini API key
   - Any other environment variables from your `.env` file

The deployment should work automatically with the included `vercel.json` configuration.

### Note on API Routes

During local development, the project uses a traditional Express server. However, for Vercel deployment, the API routes are deployed as serverless functions in the `/api` directory.

If you're adding new API routes:
1. Add them to both the Express server (`server/routes.ts`) for local development
2. Update the serverless API handler (`api/[[...route]].ts`) to handle the new routes in production
